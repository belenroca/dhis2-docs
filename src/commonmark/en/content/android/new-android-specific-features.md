## Login

![](resources/images/image39.png){width=35%}

There are two ways to access the application:

1. Manual: The user must type the corresponding URL of the server to be used and enter the username and password.

    > **Note**
    >
    > Take note that the login only possible with 2.29, 2.30 and 2.31 servers.

2. QR: The user can use a QR code instead of typing the URL. Username and password must be entered manually.

> **Note**
>
> After the first login, the app will suggest URL and username of all successful connections.
>
> You are able to make an *offline* login only if using the same user as the last online session.

## Blocking session (PIN)

User is able to lock the session using a 4 digit PIN. This allows to move to other apps in your phone without deleting the local data.
If the user forgets the PIN number, log in by entering the credentials is also available.

> **Tip**
>
>  User is able to re-open<!-- PALD: unnecessary: (trigger)--> the instructions by clicking on the three dots at the top right corner of the screen.

## Filter

<!-- PALD alternative: "The Filter allows you to narrow down the data available from the ..." -->
Allows the user to filter data from the available programs based on periods (specific day, week, month, or year) or organisation units.

## Org unit

![](resources/images/image30.png){width=35%}

The whole organisation unit tree is displayed. Organisation units not available for data entry will be colored in grey.
User must check the box to select the org unit wanted.


> **Caution**
>
>  Mobile users are not expected to access the org. unit hierarchy of a whole country. Maximum number of org units is difficult to set, as the App does not set the limit, but the resources on the device (memory, processor). We could say below 250 org units should be safe, but still believe that is a very big number for a mobile use case.

## Differentiating tracker and event programs

![](resources/images/image33.png){width=35%}

> **Tip**
>
>  An easy way to differentiate program is by looking at the word at the bottom left corner. The word 'Event' will always be in event programs. In tracker will appear the name of the tracked entity type (person, patient, building, etc.).

## Sharing Data

![](resources/images/image5.png){width=35%}


> **Note**
>
> To verify if an event is completed look at the color of the box, it must be grey; and also have the label 'Event Completed' on it. It applies the same legend set than the web UI.

### Reset search fields

![](resources/images/image25.png){width=35%}

All tracker programs will take the user to the search screen. The search fields are used to look up for a specific entity, and the circled arrow at the top right corner to reset the search. All fields will be in blank for the user to make a new search.

### Search screen for all Tracked Entity Type

User is able to search across all program of one tracked entity type (TET). In the Search screen there is a drop down which shows all the programs available for the active TET (active TET is defined by the selection of the program in the home screen). That drop down should also have an option with TET name. (for example: person)

When the user selects that option, the search fields available will only be the TET attributes (no program specific attributes).
Search restrictions do not apply, because they belong to the programs.

![](resources/images/image44.png){width=35%}
![](resources/images/image22.png){width=35%}

The search will return the found TEI's in the local database and also those in the Search OU of the user (when user is online). For those found online, the user will have to select them and the whole record will be downloaded.


> **Note**
>
>  When configuring search org. units, make sure that your capture org. units are contained in your search org. units, to do that capture org. units have to be selected as well as search org. units.

### TEI Dashboard across programs

User can see the TEI dashboard without any program by selecting the TEI in the list if the search was without program.

The dashboards will show the list of active enrollments.
